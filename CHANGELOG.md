# Changelog

All notable changes to Control Room are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The version in
`plugins/control-room/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` must
match. `claude plugin tag plugins/control-room` checks this when tagging a release.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Status bar: live readings only.** Context, cost, CPU and memory (with recent history in wide
  terminals), running agents, and events as they happen. Settings such as Frontier Max or the
  handoff threshold are no longer shown there. CPU and memory are sampled while *Live CPU and
  memory* (Setup, on by default) or a machine-load limit is on, every 3 s by default.
- **Panel: settings-list rows and cards.** Each row has its label and a one-line description on the
  left and its control on the right, at every width. Groups sit in rounded cards with a title in
  their section's accent (one quiet hue per section).
- **Overview** is a map of the product: the live readings, then one color-coded card per section
  with its systems and an *Open ›* link.
- **Context** explains the handoff in three numbered steps, with the actions beside them.
- **Behavior** gives each system its own card, with its live state in the title.
- **Desktop:** the section buttons form an even grid (one row when wide, three per row when narrow),
  and rows are spaced so native buttons never touch.
- **Overview** opens with a compact block of live readings: context with its meter, cost, CPU and
  memory. The first screen now shows the systems too, even in the short frame above the prompt.
- **No repeated titles.** A row never repeats its card's title. Behavior's cards say what each
  system does ("Keep Claude going when it stops early"), Context's reads "Hand off before the
  context fills up", and Subagents reads "Allowed  No limit". Overview's profile row has no title.
- Wide controls such as segmented choices move under their label sooner, so a description never
  wraps into a narrow column beside them.
- **Terminal:** a page is at most 80 columns, centred in a wider frame. In the frame above the prompt
  the tabs sit right under the title. Action buttons keep a blank line above them.
- **Setup** lists changes in the panel's own words and units (`Effort  Maximum › High`,
  `Hand off at  70% › 75%`). The field for saving a profile reads "Type a name".
- The status bar's sparklines appear once there are six readings, so the bar does not shift with
  each new sample. Guardrails' sparklines grow from the right.

### Fixed

- Guardrails' CPU and memory gauges read "—" while live readings were on without a machine-load
  limit. They now show the same readings as the status bar.
- In a narrow status bar, the panel button read "Open" while the panel was open. After a hot reload
  Control Room also forgot that the panel was open.
- `/control-room`'s description listed the sections of 0.1.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-07

A redesign of everything you see, for the terminal and Desktop. The design is recorded in
[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

### Changed

- **Status bar** (formerly the HUD) now uses plain words and shows only what is on or needs a
  look. "Context ━━━━── 31%", "Hands off at 70%" and "Memory 91%" replace codes like `CTX`,
  `AUTO 700k` and `RES MED ▲`. There are no separators or all-caps labels. Its button opens and
  closes the panel.
- **Control Room panel** has six sections instead of nine tabs: Overview, Context (Autopilot and
  the session chain), Behavior, Guardrails (permissions, subagents, machine load), Activity and
  Setup (profiles, display, about). Each section answers one question.
- **A design system** (`hooks/ui/primitives.tsx`) draws every control natively per surface:
  - switches, segmented choices, choices that open in place with one line per option, − / +
    steppers, thin meters with a threshold tick, and callouts for anything that needs you;
  - Desktop gets native buttons and popups, plus SVG meters and charts.
- **Progressive disclosure:** a system is one switch, and its finer settings appear only while it
  is on.
- **Profiles** read "Normal · edited" when changed, and Setup lists each change
  (`Machine load  Off › Medium`), with *Save as* and *Back to Normal*.
- `/cr status` and `/cr help` use the same plain language.
- The Autopilot's state notes and the guard's pause reasons are reworded the same way.

### Fixed

- Terminal choices could get stuck open: Claude Code's terminal dropdown opens on a click, but its
  options could not be clicked and it could not be closed with the pointer. The terminal no longer
  uses dropdowns. Every choice works with a click or with Tab and Enter, and closes on a pick or a
  second click.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07

First release.

### Added

- **HUD**: a persistent band above the prompt with context tokens, %, a threshold meter, session
  and run cost as reported, profile, Frontier Max, Autopilot state and threshold, Resource
  Governor, subagents, guard, router, Focus View and the run/session. Segments are fitted to the
  width by priority. A second line appears only when something needs you. The HUD can go on the
  status line instead.
- **Control Centre**: a docked pane with nine tabs (Overview, Autopilot, Modes, Resources,
  Permissions, Chain, Activity, Profiles, Settings). Keyboard-driven in the terminal (`1`–`9`,
  Tab/arrows, Enter, Esc) and native controls on Desktop. Mobile falls back to cycling buttons.
- **`/control-room` and `/cr`**: every control as a sub-command.
- **Context Autopilot**: thresholds by tokens or %, clamped below Claude Code's auto-compact point.
  HANDOFF PENDING with a mid-turn notice to finish the current unit of work. A handoff turn that
  verifies the state, updates docs, records unfinished work, runs minimal validation and writes
  `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` in Claude's own words. A freshness check of that file. `/clear`, a
  seeded fresh context, and an automatic continuation. Compaction only as a fallback. A START
  FRESH CONTEXT action when it needs you.
- **Session Chain**: run and session records across context resets, with reported costs only.
  The current run and recent runs appear in the Chain tab.
- **Frontier Max**: a professional evaluation policy and the maximum supported reasoning effort,
  never invented for models without effort. It persists across continuations.
- **No-Lazy-Exit Guard**: heuristic premature-exit detection that credits completion evidence and
  exempts blockers, your decisions and optional ideas. An optional low-cost model check when
  unsure. Per-turn and per-session caps, and repeat detection. It stands down during handoffs.
- **Model Router**: Balanced, Performance, Economy and Custom tables for subagents (by type) and
  for the main conversation (per turn, only when cheap to switch, only to model ids seen
  answering). It never downgrades under Frontier Max.
- **Subagent Control**: Unrestricted, Off, Ask or Max *N*, with live counts.
- **Focus View**: compact tool rows that expand in place, hidden results and inline diffs by
  default, an activity summary in the spinner, and the Activity tab with tool calls and per-file
  diffs.
- **Resource Governor**: Low, Medium, High or Custom advisory CPU/RAM ceilings, a lightweight
  machine-wide sampler for each platform, mid-task notices to Claude, heavy-job gating, and
  stopping Claude-started background tasks on request.
- **Permission Policy**: 11 categories with Claude Code decides / Allow / Ask / Deny, safe
  defaults, and invariants that never loosen a deny or plan mode. Allow is not offered for
  high-risk categories.
- **Profiles**: Normal, Frontier Max, Low Resource, Release/QA and custom profiles, each shown as
  an exact diff.
- Policy delivery that falls back from the system prompt to prompt context on machines whose
  managed guard skips user plugins' prompt sections.

### Verified

- `claude plugin validate --strict` (plugin and marketplace), `tsc` against the declarations of
  Claude Code 2.1.292 and 2.1.289, and 115 tests in `claude plugin test` (pure logic,
  engine-driven hooks, and UI on the terminal, desktop and mobile surfaces).
- Live headless runs in the Desktop host protocol on Windows 11:
  - the full Autopilot chain (threshold mid-turn, handoff, verified file, `/clear`, new session,
    automatic continuation)
  - Deny before execution
  - subagents blocked
  - the Windows sampler through Claude Code's process API
  - Router routing to a learned model id
- Real-terminal rendering of the HUD and every Control Centre tab at 150 columns, including
  hot reload.
- Marketplace install, enable and load in an isolated Claude Code configuration.

### Known limitations

See the README's [Limitations](README.md#limitations). In short: the resource ceilings are
advisory; shell classification is pattern-based; Ask is refused in headless runs; the Desktop
app's own sidebar cannot be modified; and the Desktop visuals and macOS/Linux sampling are not yet
verified live.
