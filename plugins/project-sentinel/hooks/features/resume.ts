/**
 * Resume state: whether a fresh context could take this run on safely, and what it would get.
 *
 * A fresh start (the Cold Resume Guard's *Start fresh*, a fresh watcher wake, Autopilot's *Start
 * fresh*) throws the conversation away, so it is offered only when what replaces it is there:
 * the run's milestones (structured run state), the handoff notes written since those milestones
 * last changed, and no failed pickup by the last handoff's fresh context since. The preview says
 * what the fresh context will restore and read, what it carries (queued work, open decisions) and
 * what it does next. Pure: the Runtime gathers the facts (the notes' size and time from `stat`).
