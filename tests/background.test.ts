// Seen in a real 801k-token run on 1.6.2, and reproduced live on Claude Code 2.1.295 (the events below
// are in the order the engine raised them there): the handoff turn wrote its notes and stopped with a
// render running, its Stop listing the render in flight. When the render ended, Claude Code submitted
// its notification as a prompt (origin `task-notification`, no running turn), which started a turn whose
// text is the engine's `<task-notification>` report; Claude updated the notes and the turn ended with
// nothing in flight. 1.6.2 counted that turn as the person's, so the handoff stayed in `handoff`
// forever: no check, no /clear, no continuation; /cr fresh refused, /cr handoff said "Handing off" and
// did nothing.
